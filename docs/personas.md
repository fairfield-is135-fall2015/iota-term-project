Persona Analysis<br>

<h2> <center> Persona: Students</center></h2>


<p>Students will access this website for a variety of purposes. The students can be split into two categories: those that are members of a team in the competition, and those that just want to go and watch the business proposals for entertainment. Students involved in the StagUp competition will want to reference to the website for their work and keep up to date with all aspects of the site.  These aspects include deadlines and events, the twitter feed, and any scheduling updates.  They will need to familiarize themselves with their mentors and advisors.  They may also want to become acquainted with the judges to know whom they are presenting to and whom they are curtailing their business proposals to.  The goal of a student in the competition accessing this website is to stay on schedule with the events as well as any changes made to the overall competition.</p>
<p>The students not participating in the StagUp competition may still be interested in accessing the site based on the volume of interest that has been received for this event in the past. These students may want to discover what the competition is about in order to determine their involvement in the future. Or they simply want to expand their business horizons as well as feed their entrepreneurial ambitions. They may even just want to get involved around campus and want to support their peers throughout the competition. The goal of this user is to learn about the different aspects of the competition and most importantly learn the dates and locations of the events.</p>
<p>The student’s background skillsets in the business world varies drastically. Some students entering the site are completely new to business plan competitions and desire to learn more. Meanwhile, other students, like those involved in the competition, already know the ins and outs of business world and are seeking funding for their business ideas. Regardless of their skill level the website will need to be accessible and easy to navigate for either skill level.</p>
<p>The website will be publicizing each of the StagUp events which will draw students to attend.  The main event is the StagUp Showcase with several events leading up to this.  Students will be interested in attending each event due to their involvement with the StagUp competition and their desire to further their business knowledge. As far as accessibility goes, Students generally have smartphones around Fairfield University’s campus so it is imperative that the website is able to adapt to a mobile platform so as to not limit the student’s ability to access the information that they will need.</p>








<h2> <center> Persona: Investors </center></h2>

<p>Students will be working diligently all year to transform their business ideas into an efficient blueprint of their business.  The student’s audience will be a panel of Fairfield alumni, investors, and contractors. These investors will consist of affluent businessmen who provide funds for business start-ups.  In exchange for this capital,  this investor will receive either part or whole ownership equity.  The investors will use the website in a similar manner as the students.  It is necessary that the investors stay up to date with all of the aspects of the StagUp program, as do the students. The investors have a large stake in StagUp; they potentially will invest a large sum of capital to one or a few of these budding startups so their involvement with the process is essential.  They must be fully aware of the schedule of presentations.  Similarly, they must stay up to date with the rules of the competition to ensure they are not breaking the rules, nor is the team they are doing potential business with.  </p>
<p>These investors have a plethora of other things on their mind from their normal careers, so it is imperative that the information they need is readily available at a glance on the site. For example, one of the main content pieces that should be very clear as soon as the page is opened is the schedule of events. This way at a glance the investors can know when and where they need to be to hear the pitch of their next million dollar business plan. These investors will need to be able to open the site on a mobile platform as well as at a desktop because they may be on the move or at work when they need to check on the competition.</p>
<p>The investor are not likely to access the site as frequently as the students and faculty/mentors due to their lack of involvement with the creation process.  The investor will most likely only utilize the StagUp website as the competition nears its end because that is when they are most engaged. </p>




































<h2><center>Persona: Faculty/Mentors</center></h2>


<p>As a part of the StagUp competition each team has the opportunity to discuss their plans with an advisor or a mentor who is a real world professional with certain experience and expertise that can help a team’s plan come together. These faculty members will need to utilize the site in order to keep up to date with the schedule of the events for their teams that they are advising. Although these mentors are real world business professionals or Fairfield University professors they may not necessarily know all of the rules and regulations of the StagUp event. Thus an important reason for a mentor to visit the website would be to look up the guidelines of the competition, so that they can most effectively assist the team that they are working with. They may also have a desire to see what the ideas and groups of the past have brought to the competition as a template or idea base that the mentor can help their team to expand upon.</p>
<p>These mentors most likely have fairly busy schedules as far as their work is concerned because all of them are currently employed in time consuming positions. However, they have graciously offered up time from their busy work environment to work with some of the groups in the competition. Typically, a user like one of these mentors will desire a very easy to navigate site where they can access all of their needed information quickly. They will also need to be able to use the site on a mobile or desktop platform because one doesn’t always know when he or she will need to access the site.</p>
<p>The mentors, provided they have time available, will most likely desire to watch the team they helped compete in at least the StagUp Showcase if not all of the earlier events. An effective way to communicate this information is have all of the dates planned out long in advance and visible on the website above the fold. The ultimate goal of the mentor visiting the site is to quickly check for any updates about the competition, keep up to date with the events, and learn about the rules so they can better aid their team.</p>
